Abstract
---
This paper examines how explanation requirements vary between repetitive and unique AI decision contexts through an empirical study of two XAI prototypes. We analyze user interactions with an e-commerce moderation system and a communication monitoring assistant, finding that standardized visual explanations benefit routine tasks while adaptive approaches suit context-specific decisions. Our results suggest design patterns for balancing transparency with usability across different usage scenarios. While our small-scale study (n=8) and prototype-based methodology limit generalizability, particularly regarding real-world implementation challenges and long-term user behavior, our findings provide valuable initial insights into context-dependent explanation design. Further research is needed to validate these patterns at scale and address open questions about optimal confidence communication and security-transparency tradeoffs.
