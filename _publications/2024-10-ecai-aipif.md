Abstract
---
We present a high-fidelity prototype that allows young children to create personalized, interactive stories using AI, designed to enhance their learning, creativity, and decision-making. Children select story topics using emojis to create stories with multimedia elements integrated to boost engagement. The prototype uses AI models for text-to-image, text-to-sound, and text-to-music to enrich the storytelling with visuals, sounds, and music. Parents can monitor the AI-generated content through story charts and media galleries to ensure it remains age-appropriate. While the system can scale out horizontally to accelerate content creation, challenges remain in maintaining consistent visual character portrayal and offering diverse narrative paths. We aim to provide an educational tool that entertains while supporting children’s cognitive development, language skills, and imagination. Our prototype demonstrates the potential of child-centric AI storytelling tools to impact children’s learning and development.
